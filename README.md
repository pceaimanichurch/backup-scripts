# Backup scripts

1. clone the repository
2. update `scripts\backup-script.bat` to reflect the paths to the backup scripts
3. run ` .\setup.bat` which copies `scripts\backup-script.bat` to the startup folder
4. Ensure the file id copied by pressing  `WIN + R` to open the `Windows Runner`
5. type `shell:startup` and press `enter` to go to the startup folder
6. look for `backup-script.bat`
